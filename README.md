# curatedTwitter

An attempt making curated twiiter. 

Problem Statement - Often when we follow accounts on twiiter, we do not want to see all the tweets of the person, especially the personal tweets (for some people). 

Example - Yeah. I want to see the funding story you tell about, or about any other funda. But I do not want to hear about your opinion on some local thing. That just stuff up my timeline.

Curated Twitter.

Work Done - 
1. It fetches tweets of people categorized to various groups such as >Venture Capital US > Venture Capital India etc.
2. It ranks the tweet using likes, retweets, follower count, following count etc.
3. It presents the top 20 / x tweets of each category.

Way Forward - 
1. Login via OAuth 2 Twitter 
2. Automatically fetch the "following" users
3. Categorize users into buckets if accurarely possible, using their bio, location etc.
